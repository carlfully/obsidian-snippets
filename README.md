# obsidian-snippets
Just a bunch of snippets I have created/slighly copypasted and want to share out.
Here's a list for now!
- **checkboxes v2.css** started from [Brainhack](https://github.com/Spekulucius/obsidian-brainhack)'s theme and is slowly diverging from it from various edits;
  - makes both [x] and [-] strike-through text and darker
  - reworks [-] in an X shape
  - adds [w]in, [k]ey, [f]ire, usually found in other custom checkboxes, while also implementing [.] Incognito and [~] Unsure
  - adds [AnuPpuccin](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/anuppuccin)'s bubble speech [0-9]
- **bold-links.css** makes links (both internal and external) bold, simple as that.


## Cool ideas
- [x] managing to remake [AnuPpuccin](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/anuppuccin)'s bubble speech as a standalone plugin;
  - Ended up in the same file as the old checkboxes, but it can be easily separated..!
- [ ] maybe a custom callout collection similar to **checkboxes.css**;
- [ ] you can suggest more stuff too!
