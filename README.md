# obsidian-plugins
Just a bunch of plugins I have created/slighly copypasted and want to share out.
Here's a list for now!
- **checkboxes.css** adds custom checkboxes from [Brainhack](https://github.com/Spekulucius/obsidian-brainhack)'s theme with some extra ones too!
  - right now adds [w]in, [k]ey, [f]ire and a brand new [.] standing for Incognito!
- **bold-links.css** makes links (both internal and external) bold, simple as that.


## Cool ideas
- [ ] managing to remake [AnuPpuccin](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/anuppuccin)'s bubble speech as a standalone plugin;
- [ ] maybe a custom callout collection similar to **checkboxes.css**;
- [ ] you can suggest more stuff too!
